# Movies-ETL, Extract - Transform - Load data

The purpose of this project is to apply Python, Pandas, ETL process, and code refactoring knowledge to write functions that read in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames. Wikipedia Data was extracted and transformed to merge it with the Kaggle Metadata. The Wikipedia Data was cleaned and converted to a Pandas DataFrame, and this DataFrame is now displayed in the ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb.
